    <center><p style="font-size:5vw"> What is littering?</p></center>
    <center><p style="font-size:2vw">Littering is a way of wasting materials. While it can happen by mistake (As in a pencil fall falling on the ground), litter continues to be largely a deliberate act. Whether it happens intentionally or unintentionally, littering has environmental consequences.</p></center>
      <center><p style="font-size:4vw"> Here are some reasons on why we should stop littering.</p></center>

<br> <ol style="font-size:2vw">
      <li>1. Litter Causes Pollution. As litter degrades, chemicals and microparticles are released. These chemicals aren't natural to the environment and can cause a number of problems. For example, cigarette butts can contain chemicals such as arsenic and formaldehyde. These poisons can make their way into the soil and freshwater sources, which impacts both humans and animals. In fact, 60% of water pollution is attributed to litter.</li>

      <br><li> 2. Litter support the Spread of Disease,
    improperly discarded trash is a chance of spreading bacteria and diseases. Litter can spread diseases, viruses and parasites. Animals or insects that come in contact with litter and spread the germs to students and staff. </li>
      <br><li>3. Litter is Costly
        Litter on the side walk must be picked up and thrown away daily, in order to keep canyon creek clean. This costs the school more money to clean it up. And  taxpayers (your parents) need to pay tax to help support those types of funds. and diverts funds from other projects and funds for CanyonCreek. </li>
